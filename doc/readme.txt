Student Bus and Transportation Route Alert Plugin

Description
The plugin adds a student alert icon to indicate that the student has an active (non-walking) transportation route.  An active route is one in which the current date is between the start date and end dates of the route.  The color of the alert icon indicates whether the student is expected to take the bus home today, based on the days that are enabled for the active route(s).  The alert icon is displayed next to the stock alerts in the Admin Portal student screens, the PowerTeacher Portal individual student view, and the class attendance pages on the Admin and Teacher Portals.   

There are three alert icon states:
A yellow bus means that the student has an active transportation route home from school today.  They may also have an active route to school.
A half-yellow, half grey bus means that the student has an active transportation route to school today, but not home.
A grey bus means that the student has an active transportation route to or from school, but not for the current day of the week.
Clicking on the alert icon will display all currently active transportation routes within an alert dialog.

Note:  A Transportation Route of Type='Walks' will not trigger the alert icon.  However, these routes will be shown in the dialog box if they coexist with other active transportation routes.
Future releases will improve on the messaging within the dialog box.
